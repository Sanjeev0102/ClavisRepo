Git init
git init is one way to start a new project with Git. To start a repository, use either git init or git clone - not both.
 To initialize a repository, Git creates a hidden directory called . git . 
That directory stores all of the objects and refs that Git uses and creates as a part of your project's history.

The git config list command will show all Git config properties throughout all of the variously scoped Git files.
If the value displayed
 is different from the value expected, then an override is happening in one of the other Git config scopes.07-Jun-2020
